            <p>The origins of modern K-pop date back to 1987, a year of rampant political change that led to South Korea’s democratization. In response to the increase of Western cultural influences during the late ’80s and early ’90s, musical acts began merging elements of rap, rock, and jazz with the contemporary sounds of Korean music. Here’s a look at the evolution of the music genre:

                Seo Taiji and the Boys usher in modern K-pop. Modern K-pop emerged in the ’90s when Seo Taiji and the Boys released their breakout track, “I Know,” which topped the Korean music charts for 17 weeks. The band’s sound blended American New Jack Swing with contemporary pop, a sound that eclipsed the slower ballads that were popular in the country at the time. The group cultivated a large following and inspired a slew of bands with a similar sound, giving birth to Idol Culture, an umbrella term for the fandom that follows popular musical acts (also known as Idols) in Japan and Korea.</p>
                <p>Late ’90s K-pop boom. After the success of Seo Taiji and the Boys, entertainment agencies began recruiting more young performers for intensive idol training to fill the demand for new talent. This training model was an offshoot of a similar business model used in J-pop, or Japanese pop, leading to the creation of bands like H.O.T., Baby Vox, Fin.K.L, g.o.d., and Sechs Kies.</p>
                <p>In the 2000s, K-pop continued to grow with bands like Big Bang, who debuted in 2006, receiving waves of critical acclaim. Over the last decade, K-pop became more popular with mainstream Western audiences, largely due to the massive success of BTS (short for Bangtan Boys), a popular boy band that formed in 2010. In 2017, the group was the first in the genre to perform at the American Music Awards, an achievement that introduced them to millions of Western viewers. The group has continued to chart internationally, breaking records, selling out tours, and releasing their first English-language single, “Dynamite,” which topped the Billboard charts upon its release in 2020.</p>
